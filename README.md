3. Should be able to delete items
4. Should be able to edit items (Missing feature)
5. Must be able to deploy in docker (Missing feature)

## Tasks
1. Add missing requirement #4 to the application
2. Add sufficient test coverage to the application and update readme on howto run the tests
3. Add missing requirement #5 to the application (Dockerfile and update readme with instructions)

## Bonus
4. Display test coverage after tests are executed
5. Find and fix the XSS vulnerability in the application. Also make sure that it wont happen again by including a test.

> ### Notes
> - Update the code as needed and document what you have done in the readme below
> - Will be nice if you can git tag the tasks by number

## Solution

### Task 1:

* Added a PUT endpoint with a path of `'/todo/update/:id'` to app.js, this allows a todolist item to be updated by specifying the index of the todolist item via the `id` query string parameter and the value of the todolist item via the `updatedtodo` parameter in the body of the request.
* Installed the `method-override` module and configured the Express application so that it makes use of `methodOverride('_method')` to allow PUT requests from UI `<form>` elements by specifying the `_method=PUT` query string as part of the form action.
* Added an edit button(âœŽ) to the left of each todo item, this button displays an edit section once clicked and contains the following elements: a `<form>` that posts to the `'/todo/update/:id?_method=PUT'` path, an `<input>` box used to change the todo item value, a confirm(âœ”) button to post the form, and a cancel(ðŸ—™) button to cancel the edit process.
* Added a few functions to the `<script>` elment of the todo.ejs file, these functions control the toggle of the edit section for each todo item.
* Added start script to package.json which allows the app to be run with the following command: `npm start`
